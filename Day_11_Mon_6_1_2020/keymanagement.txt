--> Password manager:
You can use a password manager to store all your pincodes, pass phrases, adresses and private keys.
The only password you should know is the one to enter the application of the password manager. The passwords are stored cryptographically, so that no one can read them. 
If you forgot your password of the password manager, all the passwords withtin the application are lost, because you will have no longer access to the database within the password manager.
Some password managers offer also the option to automatically fill in your password when they encounter a form.
--> Steel wallet:
Another good option within this case is to stamp the passwords you need within a wallet of steel. You can always bring this wallet with you to every place you want.
Another advantage is that you can't misspell the letters when you are reading from the wallet, because it is stamped clearly with a font in the steel.
