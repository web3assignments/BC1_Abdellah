I chose for the Oracle pattern & rate limit pattern.
Because I make use of an orcale, 
I decided to chose the Oracle pattern, 
so that the incoming data is handled via a safe manner.
Besides, I used also the rate limit pattern, because multiple 
requests at once could affect the performance of the application.
